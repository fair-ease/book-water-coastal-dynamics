# Tool description

DIVAnd stands for Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis in n dimensions. 

It performs an n-dimensional variational analysis/gridding of arbitrarily located observations.

:::{note}
While DIVAnd has been mostly used on oceanographic data, interpolation can be performed on any type of geo-referenced observations.

## Installation

The source code (in [Julia](https://julialang.org/)) is available from GitHub: https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVAnd.jl.

The package is installed in Julia with the command:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("DIVAnd")
```

## Deployment

For the deployment on servers, different options are available:
1. From source (installing Julia and the related packages).
2. Using a Docker image: https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVAnd-jupyterhub
3. Using a Singularity container: https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVAnd-singularity

The second solution is the most used for the deployment in _Virtual Research Environments_.

# Using DIVAnd

There are several ways to use `DIVAnd`:
1. From the Julia terminal.
2. Using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
3. Using [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks.

While Jupyter notebooks are widely adopted and allow users to work with different programming languages, `Pluto` is more recent and only works with Julia. They offer more interactivity than traditional notebooks, while ensuring a full reproducibility by storing all the package versions withing the notebook file.

# Using DIVAnd in FAIR-EASE

In FAIR-EASE, `DIVAnd` has been deployed using the Docker container.
